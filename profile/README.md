# Sign Language Learning Application

## Introduction
The  **“අරුත”  application** is a unique tool designed to enhance communication skills, particularly for users with hearing impairments. It supports both Sinhala and English, offering four primary functions: **sign symbol identification, number identification, object identification, and interactive drawing activities.** The application requires a large collection of English and Sinhala sign language motions, and collecting and analyzing user interactions will help maintain its functionality and user-friendliness, better tailoring its actions and content to the target audience.
